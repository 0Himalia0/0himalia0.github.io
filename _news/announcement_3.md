#### **Research Area 1: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) Study for Strongly Correlated Systems**

This research focuses on investigating the fundamental electronic structure and magnetic correlations of strongly correlated systems using the DFT+DMFT method. Topics include, but are not limited to:
- Spin liquids, Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transitions
- Magnon-phonon coupling, ultrafast magnetization dynamics (SOT, STT)
- Spin waves, X-ray absorption spectroscopy calculations

**Requirements**:
1. A master’s degree in physics, materials science, or a related field before enrollment.
2. Familiarity with density functional theory (DFT) and at least one related software package, such as VASP, WIEN2k, Quantum Espresso.
3. At least one first-author publication in a relevant field.
4. Experience in model Hamiltonian calculations is preferred.
5. Experience with Wannier90 and Fortran programming is an advantage.

#### **Research Area 2: Machine Learning-Assisted Material Property Prediction**

This project aims to develop an accurate and efficient machine learning framework for predicting the fundamental properties of strongly correlated systems, including magnetic properties (exchange parameters, magnetic phase transitions, exotic spin texture), electronic structures, superconductivity, and more.

**Requirements**:
1. A master’s degree in physics, computer science, materials science, or a related field before enrollment.
2. At least one first-author publication in a relevant field.
3. Familiarity with machine learning algorithms such as graph neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and proficiency in Python programming.
